##Installation

You will need NPM to install the required packages, but I have included the dist folder so you shouldn't have to compile anything.

Run the following command in the root of the project to install the required packages:

`npm install`

Once complete, run the following command in the terminal:

`npm run dev`

This will allow you to use Vue.js Dev Tools to inspect.
